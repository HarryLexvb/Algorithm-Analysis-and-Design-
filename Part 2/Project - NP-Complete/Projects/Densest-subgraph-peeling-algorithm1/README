Peeling algorithm for the densest subgraph problem. 

The algorithm appears in "Greedy Approximation Algorithms for Finding
Dense Components in a Graph", Moses Charikar, APPROX'00. 

The algorithm was used in 
http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~babis/kcliqueDSP.pdf
and was used to produce the results in the WWW’15 paper
